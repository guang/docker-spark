# docker-spark
This is my docker setup for deploying spark (tailored towards pyspark) on kubernetes, based on other peeps' [existing](https://github.com/mattf/openshift-spark) and [work](https://github.com/gettyimages/docker-spark)

Notice that things like port mappings are delegated to the orchestration tool

Love to hear feedbacks! To get started with spark on kubernetes, check out [kube's doc on spark](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/examples/spark/README.html)
